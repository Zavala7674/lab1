	<p>Hi! I'm Enrique!</p>

	<p>I fell in love with Design after serving my state with Code for Sacramento. </p>

	<p>Which led me as a junior now studying Design and Interaction at UC San Diego, where I am currently a research assistant at the Division of Biomedical Informatics, and I am finishing up a design internship with The Design Lab. </p>

	<p>Iâ€™m now looking for internships for the summer! </p>
